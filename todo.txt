Immediate Tasks:
Call resolution
    The current implementation requires the found entity to be a function
    entity. It needs to be changed such that if a function is assigned to
    a variable realize it can be called as if it is a function.

    add: (x f32, y f32) = x + y
    let add2 = add
    add2(1, 2) // this would fail because add2 is a variable not a function entity.

Next Tasks:
Impl Block Resolution
    How to attach the impl block to a structure such that
    it gets resolved after the structure?
Method call expressions
Local resolution
Trait resolution for structure
Casting
Control Flow (If, While, Loop)
Preliminary String implementation
Preliminary Iterator implementation
For loops using the iterators.
Range based for loops
Simple Code Generation (LLVM / Custom VM)
