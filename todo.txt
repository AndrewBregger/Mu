Immediate Tasks:
Block expressions
Statement Resolution


Next Tasks:
Impl Block Resolution
    How to attach the impl block to a structure such that
    it gets resolved after the structure?
Fix the function type spec parsing
    it current is (...) -> ret
    it needs to be (...) ret
    This is because it coincides with how functions are declared.
Method call expressions
Local resolution
Trait resolution for structure
Casting
Control Flow (If, While, Loop)
Preliminary String implementation
Preliminary Iterator implementation
For loops using the iterators.
Range based for loops
Simple Code Generation (LLVM / Custom VM)
Examine if curried functions is practical in the scope of this language.
