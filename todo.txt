Immediate Tasks:
Trait Type Resolution
Control Flow (If, While, Loop)
Trait resolution for structure
Casting


Next Tasks:
Fix the function type spec parsing
    it current is (...) -> ret
    it needs to be (...) ret
	This is for consistency of function declaration and type signatures.
Test method calls
Finish Pattern resolution (probabaly finish when I am implemented traits and sum types)
Preliminary String implementation
Preliminary Iterator implementation
For loops using the iterators.
Range based for loops
Expand pattern resolution
Simple Code Generation (LLVM / Custom VM)
Examine if curried functions is practical in the scope of this language.
Fix named parameters

Done:
Scanner
Parser
Arithmetic type checking for primatives
Struct resolution
Impl block resolution
Stmt resolution {expr, decl, empty}
Local resolution
Function resolution
Basic satic method calls
Method call expressions (basic)
